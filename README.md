# Beautiful News Nextjs app

Preview the app: https://beautiful-news.vercel.app
Sorry, I canceled deployment on Vercel, because the site from which I get the APIs doesn't allow me to use APIs in production/deployment, only in development.

Beautiful News app includes all types of news like business, health, entertainment, science, technology, sports and more. We present a continuous flow of links to articles organized from thousands of publishers and magazines.
Of course, you can search within the articles for an article you want, or just use filters to read all news around a specific article. 

Technologies Used:
Reactjs with Nextjs and SASS, I used NEWS_API for fetching the news.

Status ðŸ“¶: in-progress.

Here are some app snapshots:
