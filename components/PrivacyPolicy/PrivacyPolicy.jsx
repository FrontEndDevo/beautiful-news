              Despite all security measures taken, it is possible for
              Internet-based communications to be intercepted. Without the use
              of encryption, the Internet is not a secure medium and privacy
              cannot be ensured. Internet e-mail is vulnerable and susceptible
              to interception and forging. BEAUTIFUL NEWS will not be
              responsible for any damages the User or any third party may suffer
              as a result of the transmission of confidential or personal
              information that the User submits to BEAUTIFUL NEWS through the
              Internet, or that the User expressly or implicitly authorises
              BEAUTIFUL NEWS to receive, or for any errors or any changes made
              to any transmitted information.
